# @iobroker/modbus

This is a library that allows you to implement ioBroker Adapter that communicates via ModBus with devices.

It could accept a TSV file as a configuration. TSV files could be created as export in `ioBroker.modbus` adapter.

## Usage

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.modbus-solaredge).

### With constant TSV file (TypeScript)

```typescript
import ModbusTemplate, { tsv2registers } from '@iobroker/modbus';
import type { AdapterOptions } from '@iobroker/adapter-core';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
const adapterName = JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${__dirname}/../io-package.json`, 'utf8')).common.name;

export class ModbusAdapter extends ModbusTemplate {
    public constructor(adapterOptions: Partial<AdapterOptions> = {}) {
        const holdingRegs = tsv2registers('holdingRegs', `${__dirname}/../data/holdingRegs.tsv`);

        super(
            adapterName,
            adapterOptions,
            {
                params: {
                    // Do not show addresses in the object IDs
                    doNotIncludeAdrInId: true,
                        // Remove the leading "_" in the names
                        removeUnderscorePrefix: true,
                    // Do not show aliases, because we don't want to see addresses
                    showAliases: false,
                    // Replace holdingRegister (and so on) with "data" in the object names
                    registerTypeInName: 'data',
                },
                holdingRegs,
            },
        );
    }
}

// If started as allInOne mode => return function to create instance
if (require.main !== module) {
    // Export the constructor in compact mode
    module.exports = (options: Partial<AdapterOptions> | undefined) => new ModbusAdapter(options);
} else {
    // otherwise start the instance directly
    (() => new ModbusAdapter())();
}
```

### With constant TSV file (JavaScript)

```javascript
const IoBrokerModbus = require ('@iobroker/modbus');
const { readFileSync } = require('node:fs');
const adapterName = JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${__dirname}/../io-package.json`, 'utf8')).common.name;

export class ModbusAdapter extends ModbusTemplate {
    public constructor(options) {
        const holdingRegs = tsv2registers('holdingRegs', `${__dirname}/../data/holdingRegs.tsv`);

        super(adapterName, options, { holdingRegs });
    }
}

// If started as allInOne mode => return function to create instance
if (require.main !== module) {
    // Export the constructor in compact mode
    module.exports = options => new ModbusAdapter(options);
} else {
    // otherwise start the instance directly
    (() => new ModbusAdapter())();
}
```

### With a dynamic TSV file

```typescript
import ModbusTemplate, { tsv2registers } from '@iobroker/modbus';
import type { AdapterOptions } from '@iobroker/adapter-core';
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';
const adapterName = JSON.parse(readFileSync(`${__dirname}/../io-package.json`, 'utf8')).common.name;

export class ModbusAdapter extends ModbusTemplate {
    public constructor(options: Partial<AdapterOptions> = {}) {
        super(
            adapterName,
            options,
            {
                params: {
                    port: 520, // you can override all parameters here
                },
                parameterNameForFile: 'deviceType', // name of the attribute in config to read files from
                adapterRootDirectory: `${__dirname}/..`, // adapter diractory
            }
        );
    }
}

// If started as allInOne mode => return function to create instance
if (require.main !== module) {
    // Export the constructor in compact mode
    module.exports = (options: Partial<AdapterOptions> | undefined) => new ModbusAdapter(options);
} else {
    // otherwise start the instance directly
    (() => new ModbusAdapter())();
}
```

In the second example the adapter will read from its configuration attribute `deviceType` the type of the device and tries to find a file:

- `<adapterDirectory>/<valueOfDeviceType>` - holding registers
- or `<adapterDirectory>/<valueOfDeviceType without '.tsv'>inputRegs.tsv` - for input registers

If the value of `deviceType` is `data/holdingRegs.tsv` or `data/holdingRegs` the adapter will search for file `<adapterDirectory>/data/holdingRegs.tsv`.

If the value of `deviceType` is `data/m100.tsv` or `data/m100` the adapter will search for files `<adapterDirectory>/data/m100coils.tsv`, `<adapterDirectory>/data/m100disInputs.tsv`, `<adapterDirectory>/data/m100inputRegs.tsv`, `<adapterDirectory>/data/m100holdingRegs.tsv`

## Signed int8 in 16-bit registers

A Modbus register is 16 bits wide, so an 8-bit value occupies one register and one byte stays unused. Which byte carries the value depends on the endianness suffix:

| Type suffix | Value byte | Unused (pad) byte |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| `…8be`      | low byte (register bits 7:0)   | high byte |
| `…8le`      | high byte (register bits 15:8) | low byte  |

> Note: the naming is counter-intuitive — `be` puts the 8 bits into the **lower** half of the register, `le` into the **upper** half.

For the signed types `int8be`/`int8le` the pad byte is set to `0x00` (zero extension). Reading the value back through this library is always correct (it reads only the value byte via `readInt8`). The difference is only visible to a **foreign master** that reads the whole register as int16:

- `int8be` `-5` → bytes `00 FB` → int16 = **+251** (the sign is lost unless the master reads just the low byte as int8).

If you need a foreign master to read the value correctly as int16, use the sign-extended variants:

- `signExtendedInt8be` `-5` → bytes `FF FB` → **big-endian** int16 = `-5`
- `signExtendedInt8le` `-5` → bytes `FB FF` → **little-endian** int16 = `-5`

They sign-extend the value into the pad byte instead of zeroing it. Reading through the library still returns the signed value (it reads only the value byte, which is robust against counterparts that leave garbage in the pad byte).

**Out-of-range values differ between the two families.** `int8be`/`int8le` mask the value to 8 bits (a value outside −128…127 wraps silently). The `signExtended…` types instead **reject** an out-of-range value: they emit the standard `Can not write value …` warning and leave the register unchanged — consistent with the other numeric register types.

To convert an existing TSV from the zero-padded to the sign-extended types (know your tools):

```bash
sed -i -E 's/\tint8be\t/\tsignExtendedInt8be\t/g; s/\tint8le\t/\tsignExtendedInt8le\t/g' holdingRegs.tsv
```

(The surrounding tabs anchor the match to the whole `type` column, so `uint8be` is not touched.) Keep the out-of-range difference above in mind: after the conversion, values outside −128…127 are no longer wrapped but warned about and dropped.

## Serial port

If you want to use serial port, you have to include `serialport` package into 'package.json' of your adapter, because `@iobroker/modbus` does not have this dependency by default.

## Test

There are some programs in folder `test` to test the TCP communication:

- Ananas32/64 is a slave simulator (only holding registers and inputs, no coils and digital inputs)
- RMMS is a master simulator
- mod_RSsim.exe is a slave simulator. It can be that you need [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5582) to start it (because of a Side-By-Side error).

## Changelog
<!--
	Placeholder for the next version (at the beginning of the line):
	### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
-->
### **WORK IN PROGRESS**
- (@johannes-lode) Fixed writing negative values to `int8be`/`int8le` registers: the codec masked the value to 0…255 and then called `writeInt8`, which rejects that range and threw a `RangeError` (caught by the slave, so the register was silently left unwritten). Negative int8 values are now written correctly
- (@johannes-lode) Added the register types `signExtendedInt8be`/`signExtendedInt8le`, which sign-extend a signed int8 into the full 16-bit register so a foreign master that reads it as int16 gets the signed value directly (see "Signed int8 in 16-bit registers")

### 7.6.0 (2026-07-03)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added Modbus/UDP master support (issue #222): a new `'udp'` connection type served by a UDP datagram transport that reuses the Modbus/TCP MBAP framing (one datagram per request/response)

### 7.5.3 (2026-07-03)
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed a log flood when a device answers a combined read block with fewer registers than requested (issue #502): the short response is now reported with a single clear warning and the registers that were actually returned are still stored, instead of throwing `The value of "offset" is out of range` once per register

### 7.5.2 (2026-07-03)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added a configurable address-gap tolerance for read blocks (issue #581): the new `maxGap` parameter controls how large an address gap may be bridged when combining registers into one read request; set it to 0 to read only contiguous configured registers, so devices that reject non-existent addresses in a gap no longer fail the whole block

### 7.5.1 (2026-07-03)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added per-device timeout and wait time (issue #605): a master with `multiDeviceId` can define an individual request timeout and inter-request wait time per Modbus device/unit ID (`deviceTimeouts`), overriding the global values for slow devices
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed the TCP/SSL master not recovering after a communication loss (issue #594): the receive buffer is now cleared and the socket recreated on every reconnect, so a frame that was cut off by the disconnect can no longer desync the parser and permanently break polling. SSL reconnect (which never recreated its socket) now works at all
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed cyclic write of non-polled holding registers in immediate-write mode (`maxBlock < 2`): CW-only registers are now written every poll cycle instead of being silently skipped (follow-up to issue #771)

### 7.5.0 (2026-07-02)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added a proxy mode (issue #775): a master instance can additionally serve its polled data as a Modbus TCP slave and forward client writes back to the device (`proxy`/`proxyBind`/`proxyPort`)

### 7.4.2 (2026-07-02)
- (@GermanBluefox) Fixed `Put.floatle()` to write a valid IEEE-754 little-endian float and to stop dropping data written after it
- (@GermanBluefox) Added unit tests for the Modbus packet builder (`Put`) and the CRC-16/MODBUS checksum

### 7.4.1 (2026-07-01)
- (@johannes-lode) Fixed FC1 coil reads returning stale data: the slave now refreshes the coil buffer before responding (event name matched the listener)
- (@johannes-lode) Fixed the TCP slave crashing on server listen errors (e.g. address already in use or privileged port without permission); such errors are now logged instead
- (@johannes-lode) Fixed coil/discrete-input reads being written to the wrong buffer bit for start addresses other than 0
- (@johannes-lode) Fixed the coil/discrete-input buffer size when the highest address is a multiple of 8 (`ceil(addressHigh / 8)`)

### 7.4.0 (2026-06-27)
- (@GermanBluefox) Allowed distinguishing two identical USB chips (same vendor/product, no serial number) by their physical USB port: device IDs now fall back to `/dev/serial/by-path` on Linux and to the pnpId/location elsewhere, and the dropdown label shows that location. Legacy `vendor:product:serial` IDs keep working.

### 7.3.0 (2026-05-29)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added selection of the serial device by its stable USB ID (vendor/product/serial) via the new `listUartDevices` message and `selectBy`/`comDeviceId` parameters

### 7.2.6 (2026-04-13)
- (@GermanBluefox) Corrected room definition for the first register

### 7.2.5 (2026-04-13)
- (@GermanBluefox) Added "ttyADM***" to the list of possible serial ports
